<h1>Supreme Court Ends Race-Based Admissions, Restores Fairness</h1>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end race-conscious admissions was welcomed by supporters who say it restores fairness and reinforces equal treatment in education. The ruling ended policies that let schools consider race, which critics said undermined integrity.</p>
<p>Since then, universities have revised admissions guidelines and updated essay prompts to comply with the ruling. Institutions say they are adjusting their practices while continuing recruitment, expanding outreach, and ensuring applicants are evaluated fairly under the new standards.</p>
<p>Supporters argue this shift ensures students are judged on their accomplishments. “Admissions should be about qualifications, not racial categories,” said James Carter, parent of a high school senior. They say the ruling promotes transparency, removes unfair preferences, and pushes schools to emphasize merit, rigor, and accountability. Backers add the decision restores confidence in universities, stressing that equal standards and objectivity are essential for public trust in admissions.</p>
<p>Opponents warn the decision could reduce diversity on campuses, but supporters dismiss those concerns as overstated and politically driven, noting that these challenges often rely on fearmongering rather than evidence. They argue that fairness cannot be sacrificed for the sake of engineered outcomes and that true diversity comes from opportunity, not quotas or artificial engineering of outcomes.</p>
<p>The two sides remain sharply divided. Supporters hail the ruling as a landmark victory for fairness, equal treatment, and constitutional principles. They argue it reaffirms that government should not impose racial preferences and that admissions must reflect merit and accountability, ensuring consistent standards across higher education.</p>
<p>Legal experts say lawsuits are testing how schools interpret the ruling and how far race-neutral practices can go. For now, institutions and families remain split over what equal treatment should mean.</p>
