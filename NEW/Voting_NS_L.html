<h1>Voting Rights Advocates Say New Laws Threaten Democracy</h1>
<p>ATLANTA — Civil rights leaders are warning that new voting laws in Georgia, Arizona, and Texas restrict access and suppress turnout, especially among communities of color. The measures require additional identification for absentee ballots, limit the use of drop boxes, and expand penalties for election-related offenses. Voting rights groups call the measures a rollback of protections from the civil rights era.</p>
<p>Opponents argue the changes are among the most serious threats to democracy. “This is a direct attack on Black and Latino voters,” said Maria Gonzalez, an organizer with Democracy Forward. “It is about silencing communities, not securing elections.” Lawsuits filed in several states claim the measures violate the Voting Rights Act and constitutional protections. In Arizona, a federal judge is reviewing whether absentee ballot ID requirements place unfair burdens on elderly and rural voters.</p>
<p>Supporters say the laws are meant to restore trust in elections, but advocates counter that justification ignores the real impact. “Confidence in democracy isn’t restored by exclusion,” Gonzalez said. “When you make it harder for marginalized groups to vote, you weaken the entire system.” Advocates argue real confidence comes from equal access, not barriers that silence certain voters.</p>
<p>While polls show many Americans support voter ID rules, advocates emphasize that broad numbers mask the disproportionate harm to low-income and minority communities. Many are calling on Congress to pass stronger federal protections through the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, saying federal action is the only way to guarantee equal participation across states.</p>
<p>Experts warn the disputes could reach the Supreme Court, but voting rights organizations say families are already feeling the effects. “The right to vote should not depend on your zip code or your bank account,” Gonzalez said.</p>
