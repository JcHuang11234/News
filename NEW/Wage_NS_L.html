  <h1>Cities Enact Minimum Wage Hikes to Tackle Inequality and Protect Workers</h1>

  <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> A growing number of cities and states are enacting new laws to raise the minimum wage, addressing inequities in the economy. Lawmakers say the push responds to rising living costs and reflects demands from workers who argue the current wage floor leaves families struggling and inequality. While business associations warn of economic risks, supporters describe the measures as a long-overdue correction to an unequal system.</p>

  <p>Advocates emphasize that a livable wage is not only an economic issue but also a public health necessity. “Research shows that states with higher minimum wages see fewer economic inequalities and stronger health outcomes,” said a spokesperson for a labor reform group. They argue higher wages ease financial strain, boost consumer spending, and reduce reliance on public assistance programs. They highlight how wage hikes improve stability and participation. Supporters stress that ensuring workers earn enough to live with dignity is both a moral imperative and sound economic policy.</p>

  <p>Opponents contend that wage hikes are a “job killer,” forcing businesses to cut hours or automate. Critics say these warnings are exaggerated, overlooking evidence from cities where wage hikes boosted economies without mass layoffs. “Using business interests to justify poverty wages ignores the real harm of economic inequality,” said a labor policy expert. Supporters argue that focusing narrowly on business costs disregards the broader benefits for communities, especially young people and marginalized groups.</p>

  <p>Legal and economic experts say the effects of wage laws vary across regions and industries. For now, residents, businesses, and lawmakers remain divided over whether stronger wage floors are essential to protect struggling workers or merely a temporary fix in the fight against inequality. These outcomes will shape debates on fairness and labor protections nationwide.</p>
