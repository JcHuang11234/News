  <h1>Advocates Warn Trans Youth Under Attack as States Push Restrictive Laws</h1>

  <p><strong>NASHVILLE —</strong> Civil rights advocates and medical professionals are sounding alarms as Tennessee advances laws restricting transgender youth in sports and healthcare. The legislation bans transgender girls from competing on female athletic teams and blocks minors from accessing puberty blockers and hormone therapy.</p>

  <p>Opponents describe the measures as part of a coordinated campaign to roll back LGBTQ rights nationwide. “This is not about protecting children — it’s about politics,” said Dr. Amanda Rivera, a Nashville pediatrician. She and other doctors warn that denying care increases the risk of depression, self-harm, and suicide among transgender youth. Doctors emphasize that professional guidelines support gender-affirming care as evidence-based treatment that improves long-term outcomes.</p>

  <p>Similar laws in Kentucky and Florida have already triggered lawsuits, adding to the uncertainty faced by families across the South. Civil rights groups argue the measures directly violate constitutional protections. “These bills are discriminatory and dangerous,” said Sarah Johnson, director of Equality Now. “They put vulnerable kids in harm’s way and undermine decades of progress.” They argue the restrictions conflict with federal civil rights protections and international human rights standards.</p>

  <p>Parents have also spoken out, saying their children are being targeted for who they are. “My daughter just wants to run track with her friends,” said a Louisville mother. “Why should the state decide that’s not allowed?”</p>

  <p>Legal experts say the disputes are likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which could set nationwide standards. Until then, families remain caught in a patchwork of rules that vary from state to state. Advocates warn the debate reflects deepening cultural divisions in the United States, leaving transgender youth and their families to shoulder the consequences of an escalating political fight that shows no signs of slowing.</p>
