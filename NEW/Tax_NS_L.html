  <h1>Critics Warn Proposed Tax Cuts Threaten Public Services and Worsen Inequality</h1>

  <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> A new proposal to adjust corporate and individual tax rates has reignited debate over federal tax policy. The plan aims to lower certain corporate taxes while offering limited tax credits for families, sparking criticism that it favors the wealthy while providing little relief for working households. Lawmakers acknowledge the tax code is complex, but progressives argue the proposal would deepen inequality and reduce revenue needed for schools, healthcare, housing, and other essential public services.</p>

  <p>Advocates for progressive taxation warn the measure reflects a coordinated effort to roll back fairness in the tax system. They argue it would reduce revenue for schools, healthcare, and infrastructure while disproportionately benefiting corporations and the wealthy. ‘Student loan borrowers, working families, and communities of color will bear the cost of these cuts,’ said a policy analyst. Supporters emphasize that revenue should be invested in opportunity, fairness, and equality, not shifted away from those most in genuine need.</p>

  <p>Proponents of the cuts claim that lowering rates will boost investment, hiring, and innovation. However, critics counter that these justifications are misleading, citing evidence from past tax cuts that gains went mostly to shareholders and executives. ‘Using growth to defend massive tax breaks for the wealthy ignores the harm of austerity and underfunded services,’ said an economic justice advocate. Progressive taxation, they argue, is a proven tool to address inequality and close wealth gaps while fostering stronger, more stable communities.</p>

  <p>Legal experts note that upcoming court challenges and congressional gridlock could shape how far federal policymakers can go in reshaping tax law. Legal experts caution that without clearer rules, the debate over taxation will intensify, leaving communities uncertain about future funding for vital public services.</p>
