  <h1>Supreme Court Ruling Reshapes College Admissions Landscape</h1>

  <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end race-conscious admissions has prompted colleges across the country to adjust how they evaluate applicants. The ruling, issued last year, ended policies that had allowed schools to consider race as one factor in admissions decisions.</p>

  <p>Since then, universities have revised admissions guidelines and updated essay prompts to gather broader information about applicants’ experiences. Many schools now emphasize factors such as socioeconomic background, first‑generation status, geography, and leadership. Admissions offices report more outreach through high schools and community groups, while continuing recruitment.</p>

  <p>Supporters of the ruling argue it restores fairness and strengthens public confidence. “Admissions should be about qualifications, not racial categories,” said James Carter, a parent of a high school senior. They say uniform rules will build trust and reduce subjective preferences.</p>

  <p>Opponents counter that the decision removes a tool colleges had relied on to expand access. “Race‑conscious policies were one way to open doors for underrepresented students,” said Dr. Lisa Rodriguez, an education advocate. University leaders say they will monitor enrollment and aid to avoid new barriers.</p>

  <p>The two sides remain sharply divided. Supporters point to polls showing majorities of Americans back ending race‑based policies, saying the Court brought higher education in line with public opinion. Critics respond that opportunity will narrow, noting research showing minority enrollment fell after similar measures and warning outreach may not offset the trend.</p>

  <p>Legal experts say additional lawsuits are testing how schools interpret the decision and how far race‑neutral practices can go. Lower courts are weighing how institutions consider applicants’ experiences without using racial classifications. For now, universities, students, and families remain split over what equal treatment should mean in practice.</p>
