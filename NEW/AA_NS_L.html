  <h1>Supreme Court Ends Affirmative Action, Critics Warn of Rollback</h1>

  <p><strong>WASHINGTON —</strong> The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to strike down race-conscious admissions has educators and civil rights leaders warning it threatens decades of progress. The ruling ended policies that had allowed schools to consider race in admissions.</p>

  <p>Since then, universities have scrambled to revise admissions guidelines and adjust essay prompts in an effort to capture applicants’ backgrounds without explicitly mentioning race. Administrators say they are trying to comply with the Court’s directive while still pursuing diverse student bodies and inclusive learning environments.</p>

  <p>Opponents of the ruling — including civil rights groups, educators, and student advocates — say the Court has taken away a proven tool for expanding access. “Affirmative action was one way to level the playing field in a system that has never been equal,” said Dr. Lisa Rodriguez, an education advocate. They point to states such as California and Michigan, where similar bans were followed by steep declines in Black and Latino enrollment at flagship campuses.</p>

  <p>Supporters argue the decision restores fairness, but critics say that framing ignores systemic barriers that shape opportunity long before college. “Admissions is not just about grades and test scores. It’s about recognizing the obstacles many students still face,” Rodriguez said.</p>

  <p>The two sides remain sharply divided. Advocates say the stakes are especially high for communities of color, warning the ruling will deepen inequality and reverse decades of progress. Civil rights groups are preparing new lawsuits and urging Congress to revive federal oversight, saying without stronger protections, classrooms will become less representative of the nation.</p>

  <p>Legal experts say lawsuits are testing how schools interpret the decision and how far race-neutral practices can go. For now, institutions and families remain split over what equal treatment should mean.</p>
