  <h1>States Move to Protect Girls’ Sports and Minors From Irreversible Procedures</h1>

  <p><strong>NASHVILLE —</strong> Tennessee lawmakers have passed legislation limiting transgender policies in schools and healthcare, saying the measures safeguard fairness in athletics and protect children from experimental treatments that many parents view as unsafe. The new laws ban biological males from competing in girls’ sports and prohibit minors from receiving puberty blockers or hormone therapy, arguing such steps are irreversible and carry risks not fully understood.</p>

  <p>Supporters argue the reforms restore balance in athletics and defend parental rights. “This is about protecting opportunities for girls and restoring common sense,” said Rep. Bill Carmichael, who sponsored the bill. “Kids shouldn’t be pushed into life-altering decisions they may regret later.”</p>

  <p>Other states are taking similar steps. In Kentucky and Florida, lawsuits have been filed against comparable laws, and courts have issued mixed rulings, creating legal uncertainty for schools, parents, and healthcare providers who must navigate conflicting guidance. Critics call the measures discriminatory, but supporters counter that the medical establishment has surrendered to activist pressure. “This isn’t settled science — it’s ideology masquerading as medicine,” testified Dr. Robert Hayes before the Tennessee legislature.</p>

  <p>Parents have also spoken out, saying the measures give their children a fair chance in sports and protect families from activist agendas. “My daughter trains hard to compete, and she deserves a level playing field,” said a Nashville father. “The law ensures fairness and keeps politics out of classrooms.”</p>

  <p>Legal experts say the disputes are likely to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which could set nationwide standards. Until then, families remain caught in a patchwork of rules. Supporters argue the debate reflects a broader demand for common-sense protections, with parents and lawmakers pushing back against what they see as radical ideology in schools and medicine.</p>
